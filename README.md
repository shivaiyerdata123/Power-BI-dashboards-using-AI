**[Power BI dashboard - using AI - for a home loans dataset]**

I worked on a bank loans dataset, cleaning and tuning the data on PowerBI to present a realistic picture of the demographics and metrics, to aid senior stakeholders in decision making and target existing or new bank customers using data driven decisions.

[Purpose]
To target high value customers across the country using bank data on distribution channels, loans processed, demographics and product portfolio.

[The following visuals were created using Power BI and AI]

1. A descriptive analytical dashboard explaining the patterns and trends in the loans disbursed.
2. Decomposition Tree and a Q&A section using a PowerBI driven AI model, which analyzes the dataset and provides inferences [on the lines of ChatGPT/Gemini].
3. The dashboard can be refreshed on a daily basis, similar to a stock ticker - allowing the latest data to flow in.

[The dashboard helps answer a range of questions, a few of them being]:

1. Which branch across India is disbursing the most loans?
2. What is the % of recovered amount to loan sanctioned?
3. What are the key influencing factors on loan disbursement, when the loan amount > 10 Lakhs?

Visualization just became easier with PowerBI, giving business professionals more time back for decision making and deep analysis.
